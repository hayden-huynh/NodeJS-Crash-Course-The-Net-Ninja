- `npm init`: Create the `package.json` file inside the current directory to manage the dependencies for the current project
  
- Installing a package global with `npm install -g <package-name>`. Globally installed package can be used for all projects across your system
  
- Installing a package locally to the current project only with `npm install <package-name>`
  
- `npm install` will go ahead and install all packages listed under dependencies in package.json if they are not yet installed
